Permission is hereby granted to any person to do whatever they want with this
software subject to the following condition:

- You must tell me your favourite movie

You must submit this information to the software owner using the provided
email above.

More than a single movie may be specified provided they are ordered in a list
that clearly denotes the most favoured of movies therein.

Favourite TV shows and anime may also be added as a supplement to gain
increased favour with the software owner, but will not be accepted as a
substitute.

The software is provided without warranty. Using somebody else's code and
bitching when it goes wrong makes you worse than Bill Lumbergh. Fix the
problem yourself. Tom Hanks would submit the fix back to the original repo.
